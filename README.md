# Eligible frontend test

Welcome to the Eligible frontend "take-home" test. Below you will find instructions on how to go about completing this test, and hopefully an understanding of the sorts of things we're looking for.

## Overview
- You should return your completed test via email to `harry.vane@eligible.ai` as a git bundle (see [Git - Bundling](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Bundling)). Please bundle the _FULL_ repo, rather than just the differences. There is no need to host the app!
- Please branch off to do your work. You may use whatever methods / philosophy you like within your own branches, but a completed test should have a single branch that isn't `master` with all of the commits you wish to present on that branch. The number of commits is unimportant. Leave `master` untouched.
- This test should be completed in no more than **3 hours**. The tasks (see below) can all be completed to some degree in this timeframe, but it is very important that you do not exceed this timeframe. We're not looking to see what you can produce in a week of hard graft, but how you think about and approach problems, and how you prioritise.
- This has been deliberately set up to be a bare-bones application, feel free to change _anything_ in it. Add components, take them away, restructure the `src` folder, etc. are all fine. You may be questioned on the reasoning, of course!
- Similarly, you are welcome to use hooks, functional components, whatever you feel like that you believe allows you to work most effectively.
- Questions are encouraged! I don't need a warning for when you're going to be working on the test, but obviously if you can give me some warning I'm more likely to be available to answer any and all questions! Contact details should have been attached to the same email that you got this repo from.


This app was built using `create-react-app` with the `typescript` template. To run it, see the instructions in `CRA-README.md`. (spoiler: `yarn start`).

## Tasks
You have two main tasks. They can be done in any order / prioritised however you like.

1. **Style the app!** - There is effectively no styling on the app currently, and this first task is about changing that! Keep the time limit in mind, however. Spending two hours on a parallax effect would not be an effective use of time, for example. Keep user interactions in mind when styling. This is an app, not a painting.
2. **Make the lists more usable** - Currently, the "posts" are just listed out in the way they arrive from the API. You may enhance the lists however you think is appropriate, but the kind of things we're looking for are below. Please note that we will _NOT_ mark you down for choosing one of these example options! Doing one of these really well will score much higher than doing something fanciful badly.
    - Filtering by some attribute, for example the author
    - Search by something in the title
    - Search by something in the body

As the time is limited, I cannot stress enough how much more we will value a well-executed "basic" implementation of styling and list enhancement over something off-piste and half-baked.
